        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Last updated： June 1, 2016.</h2>
        <p>Instashop is an online market place application, which makes it the ideal market for selling your items (the “Service”). </p>
        <p>When you use these services—and any others we roll out—you’ll inevitably share some information with us. Instashop is committed to ensuring the privacy of your personal information. So we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, how this information may be used and how it is protected and the choices we give you to control, access, and update your information.</p>
        <p>That’s why we’ve written this privacy policy. And it’s why we’ve tried to write it in a way that’s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents. Of course, if you still have questions about anything in our privacy policy, just contact us at support@Instashop.co.id.</p>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>There are three basic ways we collect information:</p>
        <p>•    Information you choose to give us.</p>
        <p>•    Information we get when you use our services.</p>
        <p>•    Information we get from third parties.</p>
        <p>Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.</p>
        <h2>Information You Choose to Give Us</h2>
        <p>When you interact with our services, we collect the information that you choose to share with us. For example, most of our services require you to set up a basic Instashop account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as: a unique username and shopname you’d like to go by, a password, a Mobile phone number. To make it easier for others to find you, we may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as profile pictures, a name, or other useful identifying information. Other services, such as commerce products, may also require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information.</p>
        <p>It probably goes without saying, but we’ll say it anyway: When you contact Instashop Support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer.</p>
        <p>Of course, you’ll also provide us whatever information you send through the services, </p>
        <h2>Information We Get When You Use Our Services</h2>
        <p>When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how you’ve used them, such as when you access a website or use a mobile application there is some information that is automatically recorded. Here’s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:</p>
        <p>•    <b>Usage Information</b>. We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about how you interact with the services, such as which filters you view, which products you add or reverse, or how to manage your product or your shop.</p>
        <p>•    <b>Device Information</b>. We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).</p>
        <p>•    <b>Location Information</b>. When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.</p>
        <p>•    <b>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies</b>. Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as commerce features. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services.</p>
        <p>•    <b>Log Information</b>. We also collect log information when you use our application. That information includes, among other things:</p>
        <p>o    details about how you’ve used our services</p>
        <p>o    device information, such as your web browser type and language</p>
        <p>o    access times</p>
        <p>o    pages viewed</p>
        <p>o    IP address</p>
        <p>o    identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser</p>
        <p>o    pages you visited before or after navigating to our website.</p>
        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>What do we do with the information we collect? The short answer is: Provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we relentlessly improve. But we do a lot more as well, such as:</p>
        <p>•    develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services</p>
        <p>•    communicate with you</p>
        <p>•    monitor and analyze trends and usage</p>
        <p>•    personalize the services by, among other things, suggesting friends or profile information, or customizing the content we show you, including ads</p>
        <p>•    enhance the safety and security of our products and services</p>
        <p>•    verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity</p>
        <p>•    use information we’ve collected from cookies and other technology to enhance the services and your experience with them</p>
        <p>•    enforce our Terms of Service and other usage polices</p>
        <p>•    for any others marketing purpose</p>
        <p>We may also store some information locally on your device. For example, we may store information as local cache so that you can open the app and view content faster.</p>
        <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share user’s information only as described below and with subsidiaries controls that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
        <p>•    <b>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</b> We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases, such as Marketplace sellers, these businesses operate stores in our application. In other cases, we operate stores and provide services.  You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share user information related to those transactions with that third party.</p>
        <p>•    <b>Third-Party Service Providers:</b> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</p>
        <p>•    <b>Protection of Instashop and Others:</b> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Instashop, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>•    <b>With Your Consent:</b> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>
        <h2>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h2>
        <p>•    We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.</p>
        <p>•    We transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</p>
        <p>•    It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.  </p>
        <h2>Information You Choose to Share with Third Parties</h2>
        <p>The services may also contain third-party links and search results, include third-party integrations, or be a co-branded or third-party-branded service that’s being provided jointly with or by another company. By going to those links, using the third-party integration, or using a co-branded or third-party-branded service, you may be providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.</p>
        <h2>Control over Your Information</h2>
        <p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.</p>
        <p>•    <b>Access and Updates</b>. We strive to let you access and update most of the personal information that we have about you. There are limits though to the requests we’ll accommodate. We may reject a request for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users, requires technical efforts that are disproportionate to the request, is repetitive, or is unlawful. You can access and update most of your basic account information right in the app by visiting the app’s Settings page. Because your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information. </p>
        <p>•    <b>Account Deletion</b>. While we hope you’ll remain a lifelong with us, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, you could contact us. </p>
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>Our services are not intended for—and we don’t direct them to—anyone under 18. If you are under 18, you may use our application only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.</p>
        <h2>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h2>
        <p>If you choose to use our services, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Policy and our EULA, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of Hong Kong. If you have any concern about the privacy policy, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy and the EULA will change also. We will let you know one way or another, but you should check our Web site or in-app notification frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of user information collected in the past without the consent of affected users.</p>
